```

### ✏️ CRUD
```php

    // Create new record
    // The below code will automatically create user table and store the record

    $user = $db->create('user');
    $user->name = "Pranja Pandey";
    $user->age = 24
    $user->gender = "male"
    $user->save()
    
    // Get record with id 1
    
    $user = $db->get('user',1);
    
    //Get all records
    
    $users = $db->get('user');
    
    // Update a record
     $user = $db->get('user',1);
     $user->name = "Mr Pranjal";
     $user->save();
     
    // Delete a record
     $user = $db->get('user',1);
     $user->delete();

```

### 🔎 Finding data with query
```php

  // Using where clause
  $users = $db->find('user')
              ->where('name = "Pranjal Pandey"')
              ->get();
              
  foreach ($users as $user){
  // Some logic here 
  }
  
  // Get only single record
  $users = $db->find('user')
             ->where('name = "Pranjal Pandey"')
             ->first();  

  // Using limit in query
  $users = $db->find('user')
              ->setFirstResult(10)
              ->setMaxResults(20);
              ->get()
